Weather Variables for synth controls for OpenWeatherMap Parsing
	http://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions

sys:
	sunset - sunrise = length


main:
	humidity (%) = harmonic density

	temp_min = frequency min
	temp_max = freq. max

wind:
	speed = base tempo
	degree = automated panning direction? 
		(would only work for east-west)
	gust = tempo variations

clouds:
	all = cloudiness (%) = low pass freq where 0=20kHz,
		100=450Hz

rain:
	3h = amount in mm = duration of rain effect

snow:
	3h = amount in mm = duration of snow effect


weather:
	melody/instrument designators
		global patterns:
			3rd digit is intensity from 0 to 4 
				(use for loundness)
			2nd dig is next teir of condition
			1st dig is next type of condition
		ranges are inclusive

	id ranges:

	Thunderstorms = range 200 to 232
		200-202 = thunderstorms with rain
		210-212 = thunderstorms
		221 = ragged thunderstorm = 213
		230-232 = thunderstorms with drizzle (light rain)

	Drizzle = range 300 to 321
		300-302 = drizzle
		310-314 = drizzle rains
		321 = shower drizzle = 313

	Rain = range 500-531
		500-504 = rain
		511 = freezing rain
		520-522 = showers
		531 = ragged showers = 523

	Snow = range 600-622
		600-602 = snow
		611-612 = sleet
		615-616 = rain and snow
		620-622 = snow showers

	Atmosphere = range 701-781
		701-761 = fog,mist,haze types
		762 = volcanic ash (use big boom)
		771 = sqalls = 959
		781 = tornado (its own synth obviously) = 900

	Clouds = range 800-804 (default song bases)

	Extreme = 900-906  (start all with emergency beep into song)
		900-902 = tornados with increasing rain
		903 = cold (transpose songs down), play default
		904 = hot  (transpose songs up), play default
		905 = windy = 957
		906 = hail = 613

	Additional = 951-962
		951-957 = calm to high wind
		958-959 = gales (use sudden dynamic changes)
		960-961 = storms = 212-213
		962 = hurricane = 902
